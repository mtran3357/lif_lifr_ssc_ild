## Figure 3. Spatial transcriptomic profiling of SSc-ILD lung reveals that LIF+ and LIFR+ expression coloclaizes with inflammatroy fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.

- Overview: Integrated Xenium (re)analysis of 3 SSc-ILD lung samples from the BWH-TXG cohort. Samples profiled with the Xenium lung panel with custom add-on genes targeting mainly fibroblast substates. SSc data were subsetted from main cohort and reanalyzed in the context of LIF and/or LIFR positive fibroblasts.

- Figure components:
    - (3A) UMAP visualization of coarse spatial niche types.
    - (3B, ED1C) Spatial distribution of coarse tissue niches in a representative SSc-ILD lung tissue.
    - (3C, ED1D) Spatial density maps of LIF+ and LIFR+ fibroblasts in a representative SSc-ILD lung.
    - (3D) Heatmaps show the log2fold-change of LIF+ and/or LIFR+ fibroblast observed to expected frequencies assuming statistical independence across spatial niche types in SSc-ILD lung tissues.
    - (3E) Heatmaps show the log2fold-change of LIF+ and/or LIFR+ fibroblast observed to expected frequencies assuming statistical independence across fine fibroblast cell types in SSc-ILD lung tissues.
    - (3F, ED2B) Spatial colocalization of LIF+LIFR(-) fibroblasts tested against all cell types (with LIF+LIFR(-) fibroblasts excluded from the cell types). 
    - (3G, ED2B) Spatial colocalization of LIF+LIFR+ fibroblasts tested against all cell types (with LIF+LIFR+ fibroblasts excluded from the cell types).
    - (3H) Spatial plots of a high-magnification field of view from a representative SSc-ILD lung section. Cell types, fibroblast subtypes, and selected fibroblast populations with LIF and LIFR transcripts indicated in black or bronze, with a magnified inset.
    - (ED1A) Heatmap of marker genes for coarse spatial niches.
    - (ED1B) Heatmap of marker cell types for coarse spatial niches.
